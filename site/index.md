Just some experimentation with spiking neuron models.

- **[v1](v1)**:

  2 pairs of Fitzhugh-Nagumo model neurons, 1 excitatory and 1 inhibitory, exhibiting phase-coupled synchrony and anti-synchrony.

- **[v2](v2)**:

  A single Morris-Lecar model undergoing a Hopf bifurcation in response to ramped up input voltage.
